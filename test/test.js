// Tests to write

// Combinations of results from synchronisation. Need to mock the API requests here?
// Need to test the syncTime parts - make the server respond like there's no new values etc


// Mock     engine.downloadRemoteContent = function(element_paths,last_sync) {
    // Should return Promise of json blocks to with stringified values to insert into sync engine

// Mock     engine.sendData = function(data) {
    // Should return promise that will fire whenever data is eventually sent.
